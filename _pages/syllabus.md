### Full description

Radio Radius is a class and conversation series that explores the potential of low-power FM radio transmission as a tool for connection and artistic expression. This broadcasting method, colloquialized as “Mini-FM” by media activist Tetsuo Kogawa, is a DIY broadcasting method that serves as both a model and counterpoint to globalized media networks, emphasizing intimacy, ephemerality, and hyper-locality.

Throughout the course, students will hear from guest practitioners working at the intersection of sound, radio, and site-specific sonic production. These artists, musicians, and community organizers will share insights into the creative possibilities in sound and radio, the cultural significance of sound systems, and broadcasting as a medium for storytelling and social connection.

Students will build their own transmitters, capable of transmitting within a ~1 block radius, and create site-specific broadcasts responding to their environment and local communities. Together, we will explore the liberatory histories of sound and free radio, examine radio as an art form, and engage with the electromagnetic spectrum as a medium.

### Expectations & Workload

- No prior technical knowledge is required, but students should expect to engage with some light technical work like the basics of soldering and building a low-power FM transmitter.
- Students should plan to dedicate two to three hours per week outside of class for hands-on building, project development, or assigned reading/listening.
- The class will culminate in a 30-minute broadcast, transmitted locally and archived in a shared communal repository.
