### Full description

Radio Radius is a class and conversation series that explores the potential of low-power FM radio as a tool for connection and artistic expression. Mini-FM, a DIY broadcasting method popularized by media activist Tetsuo Kogawa, serves as both a model and counterpoint to globalized media networks, emphasizing intimacy, ephemerality, and hyper-locality.

Throughout the course, students will hear from guest practitioners working at the intersection of sound, radio, and site-specific art. These artists, musicians, and community organizers will share insights into radio’s creative possibilities, the cultural significance of sound systems, and broadcasting as a medium for storytelling and social connection.

Students will build their own transmitters, capable of transmitting within a ~1 block radius, and create site-specific broadcasts responding to their environment and local communities. Together, we will explore the liberatory histories of sound and free radio, examine radio as an art form, and engage with the electromagnetic spectrum as a medium.
