# Sit Spot .MP3 (Weeks 1–2)

Make a short audio recording (or collage, mix, or composition) of a place that feels meaningful or resonant to you. This could be a new recording, or a return to a place you’ve explored before. We’re interested in your relationship to a soundscape — how sound reflects your experience, your interests, or your work. Use any recording device you have available: your phone, a handheld recorder, etc.

Respect:
- Be mindful of your presence as a listener and recorder. Be respectful of other people and other species. You are encouraged to redact, obscure, or edit out any content you feel should remain private or protected.

Requirements:
- A 1-minute (max) audio file to share in our next class. You may record or compile more, but please select a 1-minute excerpt to present.
- The recording can be raw, edited, layered, or collaged — however you wish. The focus is on deep listening, not technical perfection.

### Considerations

- If you had one minute to share the sonic identity of a space, what would it be?
- What individual sounds do you hear? How do they come together into a gestalt, an ecosystem?
- What social, political, environmental conditions do these sounds reflect?
- How do you relate to this place through sound?
