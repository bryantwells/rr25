# Mini TX (Buffer)

The Mini TX with an RF antenna buffer. Cleans up the signal and allows it to go a little further. C6 is a 22uF decoupling capacitor and is kind of optional. The trickiest part is the "tapped" inductor – C5 should be soldered to the bottom of the first turn of L1. Be very careful – if you create a solder bridge between two turns, the value of the inductor will be completely off.
