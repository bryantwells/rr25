# Narrowcast

Develop a site-specific transmission. Feel free to use the transmitter we have made in class in conjunction with any audio production techniques of your choice. Length and content is up to you. Consider the relationship between the sound and the space – who might be listening, for how long? Think of methods of audio production unique to the medium, body capacitance, etc. Conversation, Music, Sound, Experiment? How is your station made known? Is it stationary? Mobile? Consider visual cues – stickers, flyers, physical components, etc.
