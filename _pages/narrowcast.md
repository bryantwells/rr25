# Narrowcast (Weeks 3-7)

Create a site-specific ‘narrowcast’ radio transmission that responds to a particular context – social, spatial, sonic, or otherwise. You may use the transmitters we built in class (as-is or modified), work with multiple transmitters, or experiment with other transmission tools. Consider transmission as a form of…

- Sonic practice
- Sculpture
- Performance
- Physical practice
- Social practice
- Publishing or dissemination

The format, duration, and content of your narrowcast are open-ended, but you should be prepared to share a brief excerpt – either as a live transmission, recording, or documentation – in our final class.

---

### Questions

- What is your relationship to your site of transmission, how does your work activate or reveal it?
- What frequencies are available?
- Is your transmission fixed, mobile, ephemeral? 
- Who might be listening? For how long?
- How is it encountered? By accident, by sign, by rumor?
- Can you take advantage of the qualities unique to radio? Body capacitance, proximity, signal noise, etc.

---

### Part 1: Concept (Week 3–4)

Prepare a brief summary of your narrowcast concept (~1 paragraph) outlining your intentions, the location (or context), and what you plan to transmit. Bring supporting materials (audio snippet, sketches, image reference, notes) for discussion in class.

--- 

### Part 2: Draft (Week 4–5)

Create a preliminary draft of your project (this may be a physical prototype, an audible draft, an organizational plan, etc.) for discussion/support in class.

---

### Part 3: Production (Week 5–7)

Continue to build out your project!

---

### Part 4: Final (Week 7)
