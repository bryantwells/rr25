# Sound Walk (Week 1)

<em>[“walk so silently your feet become ears.”](https://www.are.na/block/35413619)</em>

After our first session, take a soundwalk — ideally on your way home, or somewhere familiar. Begin by taking a moment to recalibrate and focus on listening. When you’re ready, choose how to respond. You might record with any device you have available, write down notes or observations, map or sketch your soundscape, or simply listen deeply and reflect — but it’s important to note this workshop is separate from the assignment and doesn’t need to result in anything, it’s simply about tuning our sense of hearing.

### Considerations

- What sounds are the closest to you? The furthest? <br>
- Do they come from biological (biophony), geological (geophony), or human-made (anthrophony) sources? <br>
- What changes as you stand still? What changes as you move? 

If you have an FM receiver, try using it during your walk. What new sonic layers emerge? What does the radio reveal about the electromagnetic environment around you?
